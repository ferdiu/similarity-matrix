class Pipeline(ABC):
    """
    This is an abstract class used to create a structure for a general
    pipeline to follow when it is necessary to compute a similarity
    matrix.

    It has some method to gather the raw data to produce the similarity
    matrix, being:
    - `get_row_ids` and `get_column_ids`: these functions are used to
    list all the instances that will be used.
    - `get_row_values` and `get_column_values`: these functions are used
    to retrieve the actual texts associated with the isntances on the
    rows and columns of the matrix.
    - `get_matrix`: is a concrete method that computes the similarity
    matrix using the results of the previous functions; this method will
    calculate the similarity matrix and save it in the specified path. If
    the matrix was already computed, it will load it from the specified
    path.

    There are other methods that are useful to update the state of the
    databse. It is assumed that the database is composed by three tables:
    a table contining the data relative to the instances on the rows of the
    matrix, lets call this table `A`, a table contining the data relative
    to the instances on the columns of the matrix, lets call this table `B`
    and a table containing the similarity matrix, lets call this table `AB`.

    The function provided to update the database are:
    - `update_db_row_table`: this function should update the table `A` in
    the database.
    - `update_db_column_table`: this function should update the table `B`
    in the database.
    - `update_db_similarity_matrix`: this function should update the table
    `AB` in the database.

    All of this functions should be implemented in the subclasses.

    Optionally a `postprocess_matrix` method can be implemented to
    perform some postprocessing on the similarity matrix. Please, keep in mind
    that this method will be called after the matrix has been computed but
    before it is saved on disk.
